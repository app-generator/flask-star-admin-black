<br />

## Prepare your environment

The product is built on top of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), a popular Python Web Framework. To build the app, Python3 should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account - the invitation to the source code, will be sent on your account.
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check Python (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2 # <--- All good
```

<br />

> Check GIT command tool (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check git
$ git --version
$ git version 2.10.1 # <--- All good
```

<br />

## Project Structure

The boilerplate code is built with a modular structure that follows the recommended pattern used by many open-source projects. The most important files and  directories are shown below:

<br />

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >                             # application root folder
    |
    |--- app/__init__.py                     # application constructor  
    |--- app/base/                           # base blueprint
    |--- app/base/static/assets              # Img, CSS, Janascript files
    |--- app/base/templates                  # Jinja2 files (layouts, login pages)
    |                |---<errors>            # Dir - Error pages: 404, 500
    |                |---<login>             # Dir - Login and Registration pages
    |                |---<site_template>     # Dir - Components: footer, sidebar, header
    |
    |
    |--- app/home/                           # home blueprint
    |--- app/home/templates                  # Jinja2 files (Pages): index, icons, tables
    |                |---- index.html        # Main dashboard page
    |                |---- forms-basic.html  # App pages
    |                |---- tables.html       # UI Tables
    |                |---- icons.html        # Ui Icons
    |
    |--- .env                                # store env variables
    |--- config.py                           # app configuration profiles: Debug, Production
    |
    |--- requirements.txt                    # Requirements for development - SQLite storage
    |--- requirements-pgsql.txt              # Requirements for production  - Pgsql Database
    |
    |--- run.py                              # bootstrap the app

### What is [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

### [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)
